I really liked this paper, and I look forward to seeing it published. 

I think it addresses an important consequences for conflict resolution, peace research, public policy and others.

However, I'd like to push the authors a little bit with the following.

Based on the presentation, I didn't understand the exact difference of ``communication'' and ``deliberation.'' In real life situation, comunication might be one-way and in best case scenarios, with multiple interactions. In turn, in deliberation, there is a process of agreements, disagreements, voting, etc. How can you capture a thicker version of ``deliberation'' and ``comunication''? 

It seems to me that ``deliberation'' has ``Rules of discussion'' but lefts me wondering, who enforced those rules? From Hobbes we know that ``rules without the sword are just but words''

The chat box seems an interesting add-on to your design. I know you seem to be working on that, but I fear the possibility that those dialogues are might have been mopoloized by the wealthy or powerful players (I assume you have more powerful players, as you do consider GINI coefficients among your players). As you know, weak actors really prefer multilateral instances rather than bilateral ones: it protects them from abuses from the powerful. Would something like that happen in your design?
